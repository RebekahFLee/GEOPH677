abstract = {Understanding the partitioning of seismic and aseismic fault slip is central to seismotectonics as it ultimately determines the seismic potential of faults. Thanks to advances in tectonic geodesy, it is now possible to develop kinematic models of the spatiotemporal evolution of slip over the seismic cycle and to determine the budget of seismic and aseismic slip. Studies of subduction zones and continental faults have shown that aseismic creep is common and sometimes prevalent within the seismogenic depth range. Interseismic coupling is generally observed to be spatially heterogeneous, defining locked patches of stress accumulation, to be released in future earthquakes or aseismic transients, surrounded by creeping areas. Clay-rich tectonites, high temperature, and elevated pore-fluid pressure seem to be key factors promoting aseismic creep. The generally logarithmic time evolution of afterslip is a distinctive feature of creeping faults that suggests a logarithmic dependency of fault friction on slip rate...},

abstract = {The recent 2011 Mw 9.0 Tohoku, Japan, and the 2004 Mw 9.15 Sumatra–Andaman superquakes have humbled many in earthquake research. Neither region was thought capable of earthquakes exceeding Mw ∼ 8:4. Appealing proposed relationships to predict the size of earthquakes in subduction zones, such as that between earthquake magnitude and parameters such as lower plate age and convergence rate (Ruff and Kanamori, 1980) and plate coupling based on anchored slabs (Scholz and Campos, 1995), at least have many exceptions and may not be valid. Both earthquakes occurred where the subducting plate edge was quite old, ∼50–130 Ma. The role of thick sediments smoothing the plate interface and maximizing rupture area has been considered a contributing factor, and it seems to influence many recent great earthquakes (Ruff, 1989). The Tohoku event is also contrary to this hypothesis. Clearly, much remains to be learned about these great events, so much so that most previous estimates of maximum earthquake size in subduction plate boundaries should be considered suspect, and perhaps other fault systems as well (McCaffrey, 2007, 2008).  Our perspective on this issue is clearly hampered by short historical and even shorter instrumental records. The examples noted earlier indicate that basing estimations of maximum earthquake size or models of earthquake recurrence on such short-term records alone clearly cannot encompass the range of fault behavior, even when historical records may be {\textgreater}1000 years long as in that in Japan. Here, we present several examples of areas where long geologic and paleoseismic records can illuminate a much wider range of seismic behaviors compared with those deduced from historical and instrumental data and speculate on models of long-term fault behavior based on very long records.},

abstract = {A supercycle describes a long-term cluster of diierently-sized megathrust earthquakes, leading up to the final complete failure of a subduction zone segment 1,2 . The precise controls on supercycles are unclear, although structural and frictional heterogeneities are proposed 1 . We recognize that supercycles are suggested to occur in those regions 1–4 where the estimated downdip width of the seismogenic zone 5–7 is larger than average. Here we investigate the link between supercycles and the seismogenic zone downdip width using a two-dimensional numerical model 8 . In our simulations, the first megathrust earthquakes in a supercycle generally rupture only the outermost parts of the seismogenic zone. These partial ruptures are stopped owing to a large excess of strength over stress, and transfer stresses towards the centre of the seismogenic zone. In addition to the continued tectonic loading, they thereby gradually reduce the strength excess so that the largest megathrust events finally rupture the entire seismogenic zone and release most of the accumulated stress. A greater width increases the average strength excess and thus favours supercycles over ordinary cycles of only similarly sized complete ruptures. Our results imply that larger than thus far observed earthquakes could conclude a supercycle where seismogenic zone widths are larger than average. In subduction zones, an oceanic plate moves into the mantle beneath an overriding plate along the plate boundary megathrust fault. In a first-order description of a seismic cycle, the two plates are locked together along patches of the megathrust around which stresses slowly accumulate during a long interseismic period until they locally overcome the plate boundary strength. A megathrust earthquake nucleates and releases the stored stresses in rapid slip during the coseismic period. Observations show that such earthquakes exhibit a high variability in rupture area and slip in several subduction zones, involving large (M w {\textgreater} 7) and great (M w ≥ 8.5) megathrust earthquakes 9–12 . Where and when great megathrust earthquakes occur is not well understood 13,14 . Up to the 2011 M w = 9.0 Tohoku earthquake, only large earthquakes were known from the historical and instrumental record in the north-eastern Japan subduction zone. Together with other arguments this led to the general impression that great megathrust earthquakes would not occur there 15,16 . In hindsight, we know that they can and that such superevents with nearly complete stress drop 17 might be part of a supercycle that transcends ordinary seismic cycles 2 . On the basis of long palaeoseismic and palaeogeodetic records, supercycles in subduction zones were originally proposed for the Mentawai section of the Sunda megathrust 1 . The interpretation of a long record of turbidites led to the suggestion of supercycles in Cascadia 2 . Furthermore, supercycles or supercycle events were 0 25 50 75 100 Supercycles suggested in literature Mentawai (Sumatra) S-Chile N-Central-Chile Colombia− Ecuador Cascadia Japan 125 Mean 150 175 200 225 250 Downdip width (km) Figure 1 | Downdip width of seismogenic zones and proposed supercycles.

Subduction zones for which supercycles have been proposed are shown with black circles (for references see main text). suggested for subduction zones in southern Chile 2 , and based on shorter records in Hokkaido 2 , north-central Chile 3 , and Ecuador– Colombia 4 . These locations where supercycles are suggested to occur are highlighted on a global map (Fig. 1). In Fig. 1 we also show an estimate of the seismogenic zone downdip width W for each subduction zone segment by averaging the two available global studies 5–7 (Supplementary Table 1). These two estimates are mainly derived using hypocentre locations of moderate interface thrust earthquakes, each yielding an average width value over variations along the strike of a subduction segment. They provide consistent estimates on the width for most subduction zones, although they are debatable for subduction zone segments with at present sparse seismicity or considerable along-strike variations in width (see Supplementary Discussion 1). We recognize that the thus far suggested supercycles tend to occur in those subduction zones with a estimated downdip width that is larger than the average of all (W ∼ 111 km, Fig. 1). This suggestive link between the seismogenic downdip width and supercycle occurrence is potentially biased by our short observational record with respect to the long recurrence interval of megathrust earthquakes 14 .},

@article{Mendoza1984,
abstract = {We have relocated earthquakes with Joint Hypocenter Determination in order to examine the nature of fault heterogeneities that controlled northward propagation of plate-boundary rupture from the source region of the earthquake of 14 May 1942, to the source region of the 19 January 1958 earthquake, and eventually to the source region of the earthquake of 12 December 1979. The entire region had previously ruptured in the earthquake of 1906. The relocated hypocenters lie on the same plane to within the approximately 20-km uncertainty of the focal depths. Also, the main shocks nucleated at nearly the same distance from the Colombia Trench. These observations suggest that the heterogeneities between the 1942 and 1958 ruptures and between the 1958 and 1979 ruptures do not correspond to a major distortion of the downgoing slab but rather to either minor distortions of the slab or to regions of high friction or low available strain energy on a continuous fault surface. In particular, the heterogeneity between the 1958 and 1979 rupture zones seems to have been a high-strength barrier with dimensions much smaller than the dimensions of either of the rupture zones. The 1942 and 1958 earthquakes had source dimensions no larger than the 1979 main shock, but they had stronger aftershocks.This suggests that the arrest of earthquake rupture in 1979 left the plate boundary segment that had ruptured in 1906 in a state of lower stress than after the 1942 and 1958 earthquakes. Long-term seismicity in the decades preceding the 1979 earthquake occurred mostly outside or on the boundaries of the rupture area defined by the distribution of 1979 aftershocks. The intense aftershocks in 1958 within tens of kilometers of the eventual 1979 hypocenter may correspond to a long-term precursory seismic swarm for the 1979 earthquake.--Modified journal abstract.},
